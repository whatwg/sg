<!-- This ends up being included at https://whatwg.org/workstreams -->
This document contains an official [Steering Group]-maintained accounting of the WHATWG workstreams, their responsible editors, and their associated standards.

Note that per the [Workstream Policy](./Workstream%20Policy.md), the official [Editors][Editor] listed here may have delegated responsibilities and editing duties to deputy editors for any given [Living Standard]. As such, the [Editor] position listed here is more about "who is the official liaison with the [Steering Group]" and less about "who is editing the document". To get an accounting of who is primarily responsible for day-to-day specification work, you'll be better served by checking the Acknowledgments section of the [Living Standard] in question.

[Editor]: ./Workstream%20Policy.md#editor
[Living Standard]: ./Workstream%20Policy.md#living-standard
