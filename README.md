# The WHATWG Steering Group

The purpose of the [Steering Group](./SG%20Agreement.md#def-steering-group) 
is to govern and guide the [WHATWG](https://whatwg.org) to be an open, efficient forum for
development of Living Standards and other materials that relate to or support web technologies.  It
maintains policies and addresses issues that arise to ensure that the WHATWG develops useful
technical specifications, plus associated documentation, code, and other materials, in a manner that
get intellectual property commitments from contributors and other participants.


## Purpose of This Repository

This repository is intended for Steering Group discussion, and also as a record of Steering Group
decisions. The recommended way to make requests to the Steering Group is to file an issue in this
repository.

In addition, this repository holds all WHATWG Policies, and a record of existing Workstreams and
Living Standards.
