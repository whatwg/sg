# The WHATWG Steering Group

The purpose of the [Steering Group](https://whatwg.org/sg-agreement#steering-group) is to govern and
guide the [WHATWG](https://whatwg.org) to be an open, efficient forum for development of Living
Standards and other materials that relate to or support web technologies.  It maintains policies and
addresses issues that arise to ensure that the WHATWG develops useful technical specifications, plus
associated documentation, code, and other materials, in a manner that get intellectual property
commitments from contributors and other participants.


## Purpose of this repository

This repository is intended for Steering Group discussion, and also as a record of Steering Group
decisions. The recommended way to make requests to the Steering Group is to file an issue in this
repository.

In addition, this repository holds all WHATWG Policies, and a record of existing Workstreams and
Living Standards.


## Code of conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all. Please read and
respect the [WHATWG Code of Conduct](https://whatwg.org/code-of-conduct).


## Workstreams

The [Living Standards](https://whatwg.org/workstream-policy#living-standard) of the WHATWG are
developed in [Workstreams](https://whatwg.org/workstream-policy#workstream). The Steering Group
maintains the official [list of Workstreams](https://whatwg.org/workstreams) (generated from
[db.json](./db.json)).


## Policies

The founding document of the WHATWG is the
[Steering Group Agreement](https://whatwg.org/sg-agreement).

The Steering Group has adopted the following additional policies:

* [Code of Conduct](https://whatwg.org/code-of-conduct)
* [Contributor and Workstream Participant Agreement](https://participate.whatwg.org/agreement)
* [Principles](https://whatwg.org/principles)

(These are maintained as Markdown resources in this repository, except for the Contributor and
