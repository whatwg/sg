development of Living Standards and other materials that relate to or support web technologies.  It maintains policies and 
addresses issues that arise to ensure that the WHATWG develops useful technical specifications, plus associated documentation, 
code, and other materials, in a manner that get intellectual property commitments from contributors and other participants.
